 Project Goal: create a model to predict airline passenger satisfaction level

 Data Source: the dataset comes from Kaggle 
 (www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)

 Data Processing: clean, transform, and engineer features use the next technologies:
  - python 3.10
  - pyspark 3.3
  - numpy 1.23

Model Architecture: use a classifier machine learning model and evaluete its performance with pyspark.ml

Source Code Management: use Git to track changes

all the project is deployed in a Jupyter notebook environment
